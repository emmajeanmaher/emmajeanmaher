## Hi! It is nice to meet you!

I'm a product designer passionate about nurturing ideas into reality. I love to meet new faces so I'd love to [connect with you](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajeanbudd/).


#### About me

My name is Emma Maher (pronounced like mayor of a town). 

When I graduated with my computer science degree, I wasn't sold on a career in engineering or development. I've found my passion for design in the past 5 years and love every aspect. It sparked when I began teaching young girls about technology. It is exciting to see the spark in their eyes when they change a webpage's button color. As a woman in the tech field, I think its important to nurture more than just my personal ideas. I've been a Girls Who Code mentor, as well as taught young kids about computer basics. I really love creating new designs and working with a team to make them into reality.

I'm currently a Product Designer at ATA, LLC. I work with a team of designers, project managers, and developers to interview, ideate, and create low and high fidelity mockups. Some of my work is below.
